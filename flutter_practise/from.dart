void main() {
  List<int> originalList = [5, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3];
  List<int> copiedList = List.from(originalList);

  print(copiedList); // Output: [5, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3]

  // In this example, copiedList will contain the same elements as originalList. It's important to note that this creates a new list, not just a reference to the original list. Changes made to copiedList won't affect originalList, and vice versa.

 // So, the corrected explanation of List.from(originalList)..sort(); is: It creates a new list containing all elements from originalList, and then it sorts the newly created list using the sort() method.
